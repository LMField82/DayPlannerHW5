# DayPlannerHW5

Installation - This is a web application that requires no installation

Usage - This application is used to record notes during a workday (9am-5pm). It differentiates the past hours, current hour, and future hours by color. 

Description - This application was delivered with most of the html and css written. I added the time blocks in the html and wrote the javascript file from scratch. 
It is designed to show the hours of the day that have passed in gray, the current hour in red, and the future hours in green. The user can write notes inside planner at any hour. Once they click the calendar plus button, it will save the notes to local storage and if the page is refreshed the notes will remain until deleted and the button is clicked again. The current date and time is displayed at the top of the planner.
